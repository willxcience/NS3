1. It seems automatic cell reselection is not supported. Therefore, the the number of users 
for each ENB will be fixed after the inital cell selection.

Another way is to ue LteEnbRrc Class. UeManager can help to detach and reattach a user equipment.

3. Tracing system

It seems tracing has a weird timing system, but this can be solved by introduing global variables.
Now we can control the time granularity of our controller using Simulator::Schedule().
